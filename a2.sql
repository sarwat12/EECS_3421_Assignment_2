-- Add below your SQL statements.
-- For each of the queries below, your final statement should populate the respective answer table (queryX) with the correct tuples. It should look something like:
-- INSERT INTO queryX (SELECT … <complete your SQL query here> …)
-- where X is the correct index [1, …,10].
-- You can create intermediate views (as needed). Remember to drop these views after you have populated the result tables query1, query2, ...
-- You can use the "\i a2.sql" command in psql to execute the SQL commands in this file.
-- Good Luck!
